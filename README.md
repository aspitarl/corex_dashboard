# Corex Dashboard

This repository contains a Bokeh app for exploring topic models generated with the [Anchored Correlation Explanation (CorEx) package](https://github.com/gregversteeg/corex_topic). The dataset is a collection of scientific abstracts related to Energy Storage, see [here](https://aspitarl.github.io/projects/1_nlp/) for more information. 

The app is hosted on Heroku [here](https://es-corex-explorer.herokuapp.com/dashboard).
